Windows Storage Eater

This python3 script creates too many files in a single folder, the script is currently made for the windows operating system, as the algorithms used here are based on the storage and division that the windows operating system does. The script runs an infinite loop of creation of a 100MB useless binary file. Also, for making the console screen disappear while the execution time, replace the extension with ".pyw" to hide the terminal (console) screen while the execution. Thus, the malware has now more chances of being undetectable by the user.
